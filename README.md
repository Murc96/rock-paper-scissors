# Rock Paper Scissor 

This is my first try on Rock-Paper-Scissor

The function computerPlay() generates a random choice for the computer

```
function computerPlay()
```

This function plays a single round of R-P-S
```
function PlayRound()
```

Last but not least the function game() plays first to 5 wins/loss
```
function game()
```
